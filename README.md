**Credit Risk Modelling**

**Overview**

This project focuses on building a machine learning–based credit risk model to predict the likelihood of loan default and support data-driven lending decisions.

**Dataset**

- Contains data of 32,000+ loan applicants
- Includes demographic, financial, and loan-related features

**Approach**

- Performed EDA using correlation heatmaps and pair plots to identify key risk factors.
- Handled missing values with KNN Imputer and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Trained and compared multiple models including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

**Results**

- Achieved 93% accuracy in predicting loan default risk.
- Improved model reliability by enhancing recall for high-risk borrowers.

**Tech Stack**

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
